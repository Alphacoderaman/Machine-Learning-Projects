# Wine-Quality-DT-NN-
Decision tree and Neural network model for correlating quality of wine (red &amp; white) with components like
1.	fixed acidity
2.	volatile acidity
3.	citric acid
4.	residual sugar
5.	chlorides
6.	free sulfur dioxide
7.	total sulfur dioxide
8.	density
9.	pH
10.	sulphates
11.	alcohol

Different dataset exists for red and white wine however the neural network model works on a consolidated dataset of both red and white wine combined in a single instance.
The same was not applied for decision tree in order to plot quality vs component graphs (refer towards the end of the code file)
